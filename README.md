### My story:
I've been passionate about computers and using them since I was in preschool. In much of my early adulthood, I struggled with figuring out what I wanted to do with my career. After much self-reflection, I finally realized that working with computers, logic, and problem-solving was something that I am very good at and enjoy immensely, and that I would like to make this passion into a career. I'm very inquisitive and love learning, so the giant ocean of IT knowledge is not something that I dread, but rather, something that excites me. Since about 1.5 years ago, I've been studying and learning as much as I can. I decided to aim high and pursue a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I transferred some college credits I had earned earlier to my new program at WGU, and as of now, I am just over 50% through my degree program! While working towards my degree, I've also studied and earned several IT certifications (CompTIA A+ and Network+, ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), LPI Linux Essentials). I'm overall happy with my progress thus far, but I have lots more to learn.

### My career goals:
As of now, I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge in many fields, and working on my degree and certifications. I am also hoping to get a position in an entry-level IT role where I can build my skills on the job and gain professional experience in my fields of interest. Over the last 2 years, I've learned lots about the field of cybersecurity, and that it is a field that is especially engaging to me. As someone that loves puzzles, I've also had a blast participating in CTFs and leaning about ethical hacking. For my long term career goals, I would love to explore and potentially pursue a career in a field such as penetration testing, threat hunting, malware analysis, digital forensics, or security engineering.
